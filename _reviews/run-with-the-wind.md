title:  "Run with the Wind (Recommendation)"
---

Around the end of 2018, my family bought a treadmill. This was the second treadmill we had bought, after more than 10 years after we quickly bought and broke the first one. This was also the same time that I had my jaw surgery. My face was messed up, swollen and wired shut. Needless to say, I couldn't go outside and exercise. The surgery also had a decent impact on my weight. By the time I was able to move my mouth and eat proper food, I had lost about 15 pounds (I'm pretty underweight to begin with).  So what does this have to do with *Run with the Wind* or *Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru*? As it just so happens, I was watching this anime right about all of this was happening. 

A show produced by Production I.G, known for *Haikyuu* (one of best sport shows I have seen), the story is about a group of college boys forming a cross-country team. Their goal: to run and win the Hakone Ekiden, a prestigious race that colleges in Japan participate in.

The central character is Kakeru Kurahara, a first-year who is an experienced runner but has turned away from the sport due to an incidence in high school. He is recruited by Haiji Kiyose, a fourth-year, who has building up the team since first joining college. With him are eight other guys who have unknownly joined this club. These eight are completely new to the sport. Haiji, however, convinces them to run and work together to reach the Hakone Ekiden.

You're probably thinking, "A show about *running*? How does this even sound remotely appealing?". That's what I thought to, but about 5 episodes in, I was hooked.

Although running is kind of the central motif of this anime, it acts as the driving force for a cast of interesting characters to interact with each other. Watching these guys bond in both running and with each other is the strength of the show. From Akane Kashiwazaki, an avid manga reader who the weakest of them all, to Akihiro Hirata, a smoker, these guys initially are reluctant, but neverless begin to run.

Each character has a different answer to "what does running mean to you?". Is it trying to impress your family, is it add something interesting to your mundane life, or is it (comically) simply to get girls? While some of these guys may have an initial answer, it slowly transforms over time. Along the way, the group also begins to understand what it means to be a team: how to support and motivate each other to push their limits further. This is especially the case for our main character Kakeru, who was a very solitary runner during high school.

I will stop the details from there. Apart from the story, the show has great art and music. Character designs are unique, the colors pop when they need to, and the animation is great (not just when they're sprinting in action).

The music is composed by Yuki Hayashi and it's one of the best soundtracks I've listened to for a show. According to Hayashi himself, he said that he composed the music that fit the theme of running and the music would be something to listen to while running. It can be upbeat and charming to incorporate the day-to-day life of the guys, and it can soft and orchestral when aiming to hit the emotional highs and lows of the show.

It was a rewarding experience to watch this show. It's been nearly two years since the show ended, but I still come back and I watch some episodes every now and then. It really is an inspiring show if it can make nearly anyone want to get up and run after watching an episode. 

Before the show, I would only run around half my neighborhood, which was about 1.5 miles. While watching the show, I ran a minimum of 5k or 3.2 miles. Almost two years later, I run 7-8 miles once a week. It can be painful and just tiring, but running has provided me a time to get away from the school work and staying indoors, all while allowing me to collect my thoughts and reflect on my life. 

I simply cannot recommend this show enough, please watch it. You won't regret it.
