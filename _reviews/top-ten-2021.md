title:  "Top Stuff of 2021"
---

Movies:

1. Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time
- I waited nearly ten years for this film, and it did not disappoint. Shinji's journey and growth as a character was very fulfilling to see.
2. Pig
- This movie is short and sweet to the point. It's very solemn and quiet, reflecting on loss and grief. This movie shows why Nicholas Cage won Best Actor in the 90s. He's still god it.
3. The Power of the Dog
- Benedict Cumberbatch. That is all.
4. Violet Evergarden: The Movie
- A fitting end to one of the prettiest anime's I have seen.
5. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train
- Excellent action, while having heartfelt moments. 
6. Dune (Part I)
- Cinematography is on point. The only downside is that it ends. Looking forward to 2023 for the second-half. Or I could read the book before then, there's also that.
7. Spider-Man: No Way Home
- Probably the best Tom Holland Spider-Man film. It touched on what made Spider-Man a good superhero in the first place. Also Willem DaFoe and Alfred Molina remind us why they're the best villains in any Spider-Man film.
8. The Suicide Squad
- Much, MUCH better than the abomination of its previous film. James Gunn knows what he's doing with these kind of characters.
9. No Time Left to Die
- Fitting end to Daniel Craig's James Bond.
10. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
- Finally, an Asian superhero in the MCU. His origin story was the most unique since Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014.

Music:
1. Tyler, the Creator - CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST
- Tyler, the Creator still being consistent in quality while having a nostaglic flow from his earlier albums. Great beats, great features. 
2. IU - LILAC
- Just a personal favorite. IU's voice is smooth and relaxing to listen to.
3. Kanye West - Donda
- An improvement over *Jesus is King*. However, this album is too damn long.
4. Silk Sonic - An Evening with Silk Sonic
- They knew what they were doing and kept it simple.
5. Olivia Rodrigo – Sour
- Surprisingly good debut. Kind of reminds me of early Taylor Swift.
6. Aminé - TwoPointFive
- Always a fan of Aminé.
7. J. Cole - The Off-Season
- J. Cole has been the same, which is both good and a bad thing.
8. Happier Than Ever - Billie Eilish
- Her second album is still good, however not as great as her first album.

**Favorite Song** Kanye West - Come to Life
- Production on this song is absolutely great. Lyrics are surprisingly heartfelt since Runaway or even any songs from *808s*.

Television:
1. Arcane
- A League of Legends show that actually has a good characters, animation, and story? And it's easy to understand for those that haven't played the game? That's hard to pull off, and they did it flawlessly.
2. Bo Burnham: Inside
- Bo Burnham back with another special since *MAKE HAPPY*, and it's even better.
3. Hospital Playlist (Season 2)
- The best medical show that ends on a high note and will never dip in quality like another show *cough*Grey's Anatomy*cough*.
4. Re:Zero (season 2)
- Subaru going through hell and coming back stronger is always a good time.
5. Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha
- A perfect example of how to do clichés effectively.
6. Loki
- Best MCU yet.
7. Squid Game
- Great idea and characters. Not so great ending.
8. Inspector Koo
- Very stylish and interesting-enough mystery for a short show.
