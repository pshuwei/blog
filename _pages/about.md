This is me:

I am graduate student at the University of Florida in the Department of Biostatistics.

I like trying to create and apply things that I've learned for questions that I have. I mainly use R and SAS for data analysis. I have briefly used Python and html.

My Chinese name is 张书维. I can understand Chinese more than I can speak (my friend's daughter can speak better than me...).

Apart from biostatistics, I enjoy doing about everything as long as it seems interesting.
