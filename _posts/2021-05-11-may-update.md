Hellooo it has been a while. I got caught up in all the school work and stuff.

But I can say that I have graduated now and gotten my Master's degree in Biostatistics.

I've been taking a break but I will probably start reading up on statistics again to refresh my mind. This might be the last break I get.

Since February, I have been spending more time with my classmates. With everyone vaccinated, we have been doing things like playing volleyball, eating hot pot, and picking blueberries. I think it's because we only have this summer before we all part ways and do our own things. It's a shame that the pandemic wasted a year of doing things like this.

Hopefully, our summer will be eventful.
