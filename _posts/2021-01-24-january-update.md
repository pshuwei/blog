It's been almost 3 weeks since the last post.

Now that the spring semester has started, I won't be updating this site often.

I am currently taking 3 classes:

- Causal Inference
- Clinical Trials
- Biostatistical Consulting

Meanwhile, I'm applying to jobs and I have applied to one PhD program. I have also found a small research project. I also have to work on a capstone project as a final for the Master's degree.

This will be a busy semester, but I will update every month, hopefully.
