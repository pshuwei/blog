This was my first day setting up everything to create some kind of blog site using Github and Jekyll. I started around noon, so it's been a while.

I learned a lot from this: creating posts, setting a theme, creating navigating options, etc etc.

I'll probably refine it. I don't know what the purpose of this site is yet. I guess I mainly wanted to put my stuff on here that I don't want to post on Facebook or something.

I added my past projects in the 'Data Analysis' tab. But it's also [here](https://pshuwei.github.io/blog/data_analysis/lolplayer/) and [here](https://pshuwei.github.io/blog/data_analysis/report/).
