新年快乐，恭喜发财

The semester has been ramping up now that it's February. 

I also picked up a research project to do for the semester. It involves looking at development scores and seeing how eating eggs affect children development. It's a weird one, but it's good to keep practicing R.

I also applied to two jobs and the PhD program. So far, I've gotten an offer for one of them and I have also been accepted into the PhD program. I'm still sitting on the options, but I will probably make a decision within a week.

I'm glad that I have at least two things lined up, it was kind of worrying and gave me flashbacks of 2018 when I didn't know what I was going to do with my life.

On an unrelated note, I've started watching Running Man, which is an insane Korean variety show. It's very funny and it makes me sad that shows here in the United States don't have anything close to this kind of energy and enthusiasm.

I've also started exercising again. First week, everything hurt. But it's good to be doing workouts rather than sitting and doing nothing at home.

**2/15 update:**

I added a new tab to the site, it's called Reviews and I will be added my review of shows, movies, or anything. This is mainly to help me get use to writing long things, like reports or papers, in the future.
